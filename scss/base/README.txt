This folder has Less stylesheets that contain only variables and mixins, with no rules that actually generate CSS. (That means that *all mixins in these files should use parentheses, even if they do not accept parameters*.)

- **base.less** aggregates the other files in this folder in a logical order; stylesheets wishing to get all of the variables and mixins need only `@import` this file. This file should probably never be edited, but all the other files in this folder should usually be edited at will.
- **colors.less** has variables representing site colors. I often attempt to divide this into two sections: *Raw colors* such as `@red: #cc0000;`, and *Applied colors*, such as `@nav-links: @blue;`. In practice, I almost always use the raw colors exclusively.
- **sizes.less** has variables representing heights and widths and margins and paddings. By default, at the top there are some obscene calculations used to derive the responsive breakpoints, based on keeping a certain number of colums and ensuring their widths all have a common divisor. This has the disadvantage of not actually telling you what the derived widths are without testing. This logic should probably be moved to PHP, which could inject them into both Less and JavaScript at the same time. *See the file itself for a description of my shorthand variable names.*
- **fonts.less** has mixins for fonts. I usually use bare-word parameters for font variations, so I might have `.proxima()` for Proxima Regular, or `.proxima(bold)`, `.proxima(bold-italic)`, etc.
- **mixins-generic.less** has mixins that I expect to be useful on many sites, so it comes with several predefined; see the file for details. Don't be afraid to modify or add to this if you think your change will be broadly useful.
- **mixins-site.less** is a place for mixins that are probably specific to the current site. Therefore, it starts empty.
